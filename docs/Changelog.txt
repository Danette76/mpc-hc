1.6.6 - not released yet
========================
+ Formats: The space key can now be used to enable/disable formats
+ Miscellaneous: Added button to export key bindings
+ Add the ability to choose the scale factor (relative to the screen size) for
  the auto-fit zoom
+ Internal Subtitles Renderer: Show all subtitles tracks in the Play -> Subtitles menu.
  That includes all the embedded tracks exhibited by the source filter and the external tracks.
+ Tickets #1025, #1054, Add the ability to select the default track directly by its number
  in MPC-HC and the standalone MPEG Splitter.
+ Add a new shader that over brightens with gradient from the bottom to the top of the screen.
  It needs LCD monitors with low viewing angle (~170/160).
* UI: Use a more native look and feel for the options dialog tree

* More resilient support for MPL2 and SRT subtitles formats:
  - Ticket #2779, Support MicroDVD tags in MPL2 subtitles files. This is normally not
    supported but MPL2 files that use MicroDVD tags for formatting are quite common.

! Ticket #2805, AviSplitter: Fix a crash when closing the file while re-indexing

  end of the file wasn't played.
